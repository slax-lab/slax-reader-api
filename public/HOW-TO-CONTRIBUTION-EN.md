### 📜 Contributor Agreement

**Important note:** Your submitted Pull Request may be merged or incorporated into our commercial version. Before submitting a PR, you need to sign our contributor informed consent.

We use [CLA Assistant](https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant) Bot to manage this process.

You only need to click the link and follow the prompts to complete the signing. This process only needs to be completed once during your first contribution.

Once the signing process is complete, the Bot will automatically update your PR status, indicating your agreement to our terms. Please note that PRs without a signed informed consent cannot be merged.

## 🎨 Code Style Guide

Our project follows these core specifications:

### 1. Architecture Design

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
  - Clear layered architecture: presentation layer, application layer, domain layer, and infrastructure layer
  - Use of explicit bounded contexts to separate different business domains
  - Ensuring one-way flow of dependencies between layers

### 2. Development Standards

- **Dependency Injection**

  - Using decorators to implement dependency injection and inversion of control
  - Avoiding singletons and static methods
  - Injecting dependencies through constructors to improve code testability

- **TypeScript Coding Standards**

  - File naming: use camelCase (e.g., `userService.ts`)
  - Class naming: use PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`)
  - Method naming: use camelCase (e.g., `createUser`)
  - Interface naming: use PascalCase (e.g., `UserInterface`)

- **Asynchronous Processing**
  - Prioritize using async/await for asynchronous operations
  - Avoid callback hell, keep code flat

### 3. Code Quality

- **Error Handling**

  - Use custom error classes for error categorization
  - Unified error handling mechanism
  - Standardized error response format

- **Comment Standards**

  - Provide clear documentation comments for public APIs
  - Add necessary explanatory comments for complex logic
  - Use TODO/FIXME and other markers for issues to be addressed

Please ensure your code complies with these guidelines to maintain consistency and maintainability in the codebase. If in doubt, refer to existing code implementations.

## 🧪 Testing
